# thegamingroom

The gaming room is one of our first clients. These are some of the questions you might ask while looking at the post.

-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
 They wanted a cross-platform game which they had built already. They wanted to translate this game to make a cross platform game. 

-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In this program, I did really well in developing the objects and classes in this object oriented program. The classes were pretty well planned and laid out.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found it really helpful to use the UML design and tranlate that into java code. It laid out the objects and classes I needed to build. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I definetly need to work on the documnetation part of my program. Although I used commments to lay out the code, I could have still had used better practices. 

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User's needs are very important and actually a key in the sucess of any program. I used the needs of the user who's storage capability might have been limited.

=How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I tried to keep the code clean and simple. Also with minimal redundanies, this was one of my main prioties. It was also very important to use the principles of OOP into designing this software.
